    <p>In past, Nepal was divided into 46 independent principalities. King Prithvi Narayan Shah, then Shah Ruler of the kingdom Gorkha, unified 46 independent principalities into one nation. The nation was then called Nepal. Before the event of unification, there were several eras in Nepal. Kirat era is believed to be the first era followed by Licchavi era. It was during Licchavi era that arts and architecture were brought into the country. After Licchavi era, Malla era took over. Malla era is said to be the golden age because the country then had well-organized societies. Literature, music and arts were promoted. Malla era was followed by Shah Dynasty, and it was this dynasty when the unification of Nepal took place. In 2001, a horrific tragedy occurred. It was the Royal Massacre. The entire Royal family was assassinated leaving the King’s brother and his family. This brought an end to the Shah Dynasty and abolished 240-year-old constitutional monarchy system of Nepal. Today, Nepal is established as Federal Democratic Republic with President as the Head of the State. </p>
